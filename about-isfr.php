            The first ISFR conference was held in Frankfurt am Main, Germany in 1967 and subsequent conferences have been held in Spain, Austria, the Netherlands, England, the United States of America, Switzerland, India, Japan, Hungary, the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China, Poland, New Zealand, Canada, Iran, and Thailand. <br><br>
            The Society does not hold an official position on issues, such as water fluoridation and environmental fluoride pollution, but encourages, through its conferences, and the publication of papers, commentaries, and letters to the editor, a critical examination of the scientific basis of the views which are held by individuals and organizations.
